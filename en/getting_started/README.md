# Getting Started

This topic explains how to set up a development environment and write a minimal example for all our supported programming languages/platforms.

> **Note** At time of writing all users will need to [build the library](../contributing/build.md) in order to use it. In the near future we'll have binary releases for the wrapper APIs.  
>
> The [Guide](../guide/README.md) explains how to write C++ DroneCore apps. A simple complete example can be found in [Takeoff and Land](../examples/takeoff_and_land.md).
